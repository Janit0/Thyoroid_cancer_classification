# Thyoroid_cancer_classification

This project is to create a classification prediction model for the correct diagnosis of the type of thyroid cancer (Benign &amp; Malignant).

**Project Objectives:**
1. Analyse and gain insights from the features.
2. Predict diaignosis with optimum scoring.
3. Fine tune models to gain better scores.

**Dataset Info:**
This dataset contains 212,691 records with 23 attributes, simulating real-world thyroid cancer risk factors and focused towards certain ethnicites, risk factors such as radiation exposure, smoking, diabetes and many more.

**Method of Approach**: 
The approached followed is firstly, to create different visualizations and graphs to gain insights of the data. Secondly, to create both descriptive and predictive models such as Logit, Log Reg, Decision tree and KNN.

Then, compare the results keeping "f1 score" as the main scoring parameter along with keeping over fitting or underfitting in check.

**Results**:
1. Successfully gained insights required.
2. Fine tuned models and eliminated risks of over and undefitting.
3. Authentic comparision of both base and fine tuned models.
